<h1>SFC Scannow Command</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project centres on the utilisation of the System File Checker (SFC) tool within a Windows environment. SFC is a command-line utility designed to verify the integrity of system files and rectify any identified issues. The aim is to illustrate how to execute the SFC /scannow command in Command Prompt and interpret the results effectively.</p>

<h2>Key Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Understanding SFC:</strong> Delve into the purpose and advantages of the SFC tool for verifying system file integrity.</li>
    <li><strong>Performing SFC Scan:</strong> Execute the SFC /scannow command in Command Prompt to initiate the scanning process.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpreting Results:</strong> Analyse the scan results to ascertain the presence or absence of integrity violations in the system files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
<p><strong>Utilities:</strong> Command Prompt (CMD)</p>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>
<p><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Windows</p>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong> PC</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Command Prompt</p>

<h2>Program Walk-through:</h2>

<p><strong>Open Command Prompt:</strong> Access Command Prompt by searching for "CMD" in the Windows search bar.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8kXRCp0.png" alt="Run SFC Scan">
<p><strong>Run SFC Scan:</strong> Input the command "sfc /scannow" into the Command Prompt window and press Enter. This initiates the System File Checker (SFC) scan.</p>

<p><strong>Verification Process:</strong> Allow the scan to progress. The SFC tool will verify the integrity of system files on your Windows system. This process may take some time to complete.</p>

<p><strong>Review Results:</strong> After the scan is complete, examine the results displayed in the Command Prompt window. If no integrity violations are found, you will receive a message confirming that no issues were detected.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Analyse the results to ensure no integrity violations were reported. If any issues were found, the SFC tool attempts to repair them automatically or provides guidance on further actions needed.</p>

<p><strong>Completion:</strong> Once the scan is finished, close the Command Prompt window. You have successfully utilised the SFC /scannow command to check for system file integrity on your Windows system.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this project, we successfully set up a SIEM dashboard using Elastic Cloud, integrated various data sources, and configured alerts to enhance our security monitoring capabilities. The utilisation of Kali Linux and Elastic Agent allowed us to gain valuable insights into network activities and potential threats.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Throughout this project, I learned the significance of proactive monitoring and the value of integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive security visibility. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with Elastic Cloud and its powerful visualisation tools.</p>

<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>Moving forward, I plan to explore advanced alerting features in Elastic Cloud and further refine the dashboard to include more detailed visualisations. I will also demonstrate how to add SSL for enhanced security, ensuring that data in transit is encrypted and secure.</p>
